**Deep convolutional neural network implemented in Keras with TensorFlow backend**

This network was trained on the Kaggle cat-dog classification competition dataset. Dream was implemented loosely based off of https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/deep_dream.py, except the convnet was manually architected and trained. The architecture is also inspired by VGGNet16, but with fewer and less complex convolutional layers.
